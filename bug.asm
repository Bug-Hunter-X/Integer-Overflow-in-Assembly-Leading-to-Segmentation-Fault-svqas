mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4]

This line of assembly code attempts to access memory at the address calculated by ebx + ecx * 4.  The bug arises if the value of ecx is very large, causing integer overflow. This overflow can lead to accessing memory outside of the allocated space for the program, resulting in a segmentation fault or other unpredictable behavior.  The calculated address may wrap around to a lower address, potentially overwriting crucial data or code.
